 1.    INTRODUCTION
 The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android ("FDK AAC Codec") is software
 that implements the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding ("AAC") encoding and decoding
 scheme for digital audio. This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on
 a wide variety of Android devices.
 .
 AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient
 general perceptual audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing
 full-bandwidth communications codec by independent studies and is widely
 deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part of the MPEG
 specifications.
 .
 Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including
 those of Fraunhofer) may be obtained through Via Licensing
 (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners individually for
 the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant
 with the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of
 Android devices already license these patent claims through Via Licensing or
 directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec software may
 already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those
 licensed purposes only.
 .
 Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions
 with enhanced sound quality, are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are
 encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional applications
 information and documentation.
 .
 2.    COPYRIGHT LICENSE
 .
 Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,
 are permitted without payment of copyright license fees provided that you
 satisfy the following conditions:
 .
 You must retain the complete text of this software license in redistributions of
 the FDK AAC Codec or your modifications thereto in source code form.
 .
 You must retain the complete text of this software license in the documentation
 and/or other materials provided with redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or
 your modifications thereto in binary form. You must make available free of
 charge copies of the complete source code of the FDK AAC Codec and your
 modifications thereto to recipients of copies in binary form.
 .
 The name of Fraunhofer may not be used to endorse or promote products derived
 from this library without prior written permission.
 .
 You may not charge copyright license fees for anyone to use, copy or distribute
 the FDK AAC Codec software or your modifications thereto.
 .
 Your modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec must carry prominent notices stating
 that you changed the software and the date of any change. For modified versions
 of the FDK AAC Codec, the term "Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android"
 must be replaced by the term "Third-Party Modified Version of the Fraunhofer FDK
 AAC Codec Library for Android."
 .
 3.    NO PATENT LICENSE
 .
 NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED LICENSES TO ANY PATENT CLAIMS, including without
 limitation the patents of Fraunhofer, ARE GRANTED BY THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE.
 Fraunhofer provides no warranty of patent non-infringement with respect to this
 software.

 You may use this FDK AAC Codec software or modifications thereto only for
 purposes that are authorized by appropriate patent licenses.
